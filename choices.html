<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


<p>There are six levels of self-driving cars ranging from no assistance to the human driver, to fully automated and no human driver is needed.<p>
	<p>Level 0: The human driver performs all tasks although the car may have fixed cruise control hardware or warn an oncoming crash but is unable to take action to stop it. </p>
	<p> Level 1: The vehicle has an automated system which can sometimes assist the human driver and conduct some simple parts of the driving task. For a car to be at level 1 it must have at least one advanced driver-assistance feature such as adaptive cruise control which keeps the car a specified distance away from the car in front or if there is no car in front it resumes driving at a specified speed or the speed limit for that area. Lane assistance is another example of a driver assistance feature which just helps to keep the car in the desired lane without crossing over the lines.</p>
<p> Level 2: This is where an automated system on the car self-sufficiently can conduct some part s of the driving task but requires the human driver to oversee and monitor the driving environment and perform the rest of the task. An example of this adaptive cruise control, active lane-keep assist or automatic emergency braking, and these technologies must be applied in a coordinated fashion. It is the use of two or more driver assisted features that brings the car from level 1 automation to level 2.</p>
	<p>Level 3: At this level, the car has an automated system where the vehicle can perform some of the driving tasks and in some instances also monitor its environment and surroundings. This means that the human driver must also be monitoring their surroundings and be ready to take back control when prompted. For example, a car that can take its passenger on and off the motorway including on ramps and off ramps while keeping a safe speed and distance from the cars around them would be considered a level 3 self-driving car. </p> 
	<p> Level 4: The car can drive under many conditions without the human driver needing to intervene and, in many cases, would be able to take passengers on a full journey without any support from a human driver. Some restraints on these cars may be that they are confined to a certain geographical area or that they cannot go over a certain speed limit. </p>
	<p>Level 5: At the last level of automation in self-driving cars, the car is fully self-sustainable and can drive under all conditions without any support from a human driver. These cars are what all self-driving vehicle developers aim for, it is where the car is so self-sufficient that the car does not even need a steering wheel and the passenger does not have to pay any attention to their surroundings (Hyatt & Paukert, 2018).</p>
