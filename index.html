<h1>The Safety of Self-Driving Cars</h1>


</ul><p> Our topic concerns the safety aspect of technology in society, targeting Autonomous Vehicles, specifically Artificial Intelligence and safety in Self driving cars. Technology and the development of Artificial Intelligence is constantly evolving in society and the next step for transportation is to have self-driving cars. With many companies such as Google, Uber, BMW, Volkswagen, Tesla, Volvo, Apple, Intel and Bosch making investments and making numerous acquisitions, means that level 5 self-driving cars are not far away.</p>
<p>Self-driving cars will reduce accidents on the road as they will eliminate human error and instead focus on using techniques such as audible cues, patterned lights, rooftop displays, lazer projections onto sidewalks and vehicle to vehicle transmission of driver intentions to drive according to the conditions. This will make transportation much safer as human error is the leading cause of car accidents on the road.</p>
