<h1>Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous Vehicles: Self-Driving Cars</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>

	<p>Our topic concerns the safety aspect of technology in society, targeting Autonomous Vehicles, specifically Artificial Intelligence in Self-driving cars. 
		AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in society with cars adapting many features of what a fully self-sufficient self-driving car would have.</p>
	<p>Having self-driving cars has many safety benefits and is an inclusive way to get from place to place. With companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Uber making 
		huge investments in this market, it is likely we will have fully self-sufficient self-driving cars in the near future (Baecker, 2019).</p>
	<p>World Health Organization [WHO] (2022) estimates 1.3 million people die each year from road traffic injuries. 94% of all traffic crashes in the United States 
		in 2015 were thought to have been caused by human error and human error accounted for 75% of traffic crashes in the United Kingdom in 2017 
		(as cited in Liu et al., 2019). With the number of road casualties being so high, something needs to change!</p>
