<h1>Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous Vehicles: Self-Driving Cars</h1>


</ul>
	<p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly prevalent in society and has been revolutionary in many industries. There has been significant development
		in the automotive sector with cars adapting many features of what a fully self-sufficient self-driving car would have. With this new technology there
		will be an option to fully replace human drivers with autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have many safety benefits and are an inclusive way to get from place to place. 
		With companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Uber making 
		huge investments in this market, it is likely we will have fully self-sufficient self-driving cars on the roads in the near future (Baecker, 2019).</p>
	
	<p>Self-driving cars rely on numerous sensors such as Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receivers, radar sensors, sonar, lidar, to gather and analyse the car's surroundings.
		They use these sensors to determine
	if there are any nearby obstacles, determine the car's current location, assess it's movement, and identify any traffic-safety features such as stop signs or traffic lights. Self-driving cars 
	also heavily rely on digital maps which are extremely detailed, road-level images of each street the car may drive on. These images coupled with GPS location tells the self-driving 
	car how the road is supposed to look like at it's current location (Surden & Williams, 2016).</p>
	
	<p>The benefits of self-driving cars could be revolutionary. The World Health Organization [WHO] (2022) estimates 1.3 million people die each year from road traffic injuries. WHO states that the leading cause of deaths in 5-29 year
		olds is road traffic injuries. This is comparable to research by Ritchie et al. (2019) who found road traffic injuries to be the third leading cause of death in 15-49
		 year olds, as shown in Figure 1. These high road casualty figures highlight the need for change to address the issue of safety. Additionally, human error is a significant factor in the majority of road accidents;
		 94% of all traffic crashes in the United States in 2015 were thought to have been caused by human error and human error accounted for 75% of traffic crashes 
		in the United Kingdom in 2017 (as cited in Liu et al., 2019). This prevalence of human-related errors shows the potential for self-driving cars to be the change needed to reduce road casualties.</p>

	<p>Factors such as speeding, drink driving, and distracted driving all increase a person's crash risk. According to WHO (2022), there is a direct correlation between mean speed and the liklihood 
		of a fatal crash. They claim that there is a 4% increase in risk of a fatal crash
		for every 1% increase in mean speed, highlighting the critical role speed plays in road safety. Another significant risk factor is distracted driving.
		WHO (2022) reports that those using mobile phones while driving are 4 times more likely to crash than those not using their mobile
		phones. Additionally, driving under the influence of amphetamines increases a persons risk of a fatal crash by approximately 5 times. 
		National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] (n.d.) estimates 37 people die everyday in the United States as a result of drunk-driving. Alcohol can cause a loss 
		of judgement, reduced coordination and impaired perception with drivers struggling to stay inside their lane and worsening their responses to emergency driving situations. 
		These risk factors are all preventable. 
		By addressing these risk factors, there could be an increase road safety and reduced number of road casualties. Self-driving cars address these factors and hence could be a safer alternative to human drivers.</p>
