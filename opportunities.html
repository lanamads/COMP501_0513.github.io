<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

	<p>Self-Driving cars have the ability to reduce road traffic accidents by eliminating accidents caused by human error. 
		Studys agree that at least 90% of car accidents are caused by human error (Baecker, 2019; Coicheci & Filip, 2020; Liu et al., 2019). 
		Self-driving cars are able to communicate with each other and their surroundings, eliminating major accident causes such as speeding, 
		drink driving, tiredness, reckless and distracted driving, running red lights and stop signs. Self-driving cars are extensively tested in simulations to 
		find and fix any bugs in the technology (Baecker, 2019). Waymo is an automated driving system created by Google that has been tested with simulated real-world 
		fatal collision scenarios. They were able to reconstruct 72 crash simulations with the Waymo driver tested as both the crash initiator and the responder. 
		From these simulations they found their self-driving vehicles prevented initiation of every fatal collision. The results showed the system prevented approximately 
		82% of collisions and mitigated a further 10% of collisions when responding to the actions of the crash (Scanlon et al., 2021). This study shows there is potential 
		for self-driving cars to improve road safety by reducing road traffic accidents.</p>
